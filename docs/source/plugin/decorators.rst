About ``sopel.module``
======================

Before Sopel 7.1, ``sopel.module`` was the preferred and only way to decorate
callables for plugins. However, since the term ``module`` can be confusing
(mostly because it already has a special meaning in Python), it has been
replaced by ``plugin`` in most cases related to add-ons for Sopel.
