What is a Plugin?
=================

Before writing your first plugin, you may want to know what is a plugin, how is
it made, and what are the best solutions for your needs. In this chapter we'll
cover what is a plugin, what you can do with them, and some vocabulary.

You may want to skip ahead to :doc:`anatomy` if you already know what a plugin
is and what types of plugin there are.

Plugin Types
============

There are four types of plugins: :term:`Single file plugin`,
:term:`Folder plugin`, :term:`Namespace package plugin`, and
:term:`Entry point plugin`.

Single file
-----------

A **Single file** plugin is the most basic form a Sopel plugin can take. It is
composed of a single file available to Sopel from its plugins directory (or
from one of its
:attr:`extra directories <sopel.config.core_section.CoreSection.extra>`). You
can write a single file plugin when:

* everything is in a single file
* either:
   * dependencies are limited to Sopel and Python's built-in library; or
   * your plugin is a "one-off" for your use only (not intended to be shared)

This type of plugin is easy to install: copy its file into the right location,
and Sopel will load it on startup.

.. note::

   You *can* still use extra dependencies with a single file plugin. Bot owners
   will have to install them manually, so you should probably document them,
   and possibly list them in a ``requirements.txt`` file to be used with
   ``pip install -r`` if you want to simplify the installation process.

Folder
------

A **Folder** plugin is a folder that contains a ``__init__.py`` file. It is
available to Sopel the same way a :ref:`Single file` plugin is, and shares the
same warnings/advice:

* everything that is not available in this ``__init__.py`` file won't be
  visible to Sopel
* either:
   * dependencies should be limited to Sopel and Python's built-in library,
     for ease of installation; or
   * the plugin is a "one-off", not intended to be shared

By default, Sopel's plugin directories are **not** available in ``sys.path``,
so it is not possible to do ``from my_plugin_dir import some_module`` without
a specific configuration from the bot's owner.

When a plugin author wants to split code into different files, and/or share it
between multiple plugins, the best option is to use an :ref:`Entry point`
plugin instead.

.. note::

   Just like single file plugins, you *can* use extra dependencies with folder
   plugins; the same advice about ``requirements.txt`` and ``pip`` applies.

Namespace package (deprecated)
------------------------------

.. warning::

   This type of package is deprecated in Sopel 8.1 and will be removed from
   Sopel 9. Plugin authors can migrate their plugins to Sopel's Entry point
   type of plugins if they wish to maintain a Sopel 9 compatible plugin.

.. deprecated:: 8.1

A **Namespace package** plugin is a Python :term:`namespace package`, using
the namespace ``sopel_modules``. It must be installed in the Python environment
to be used by Sopel, and can require Python dependencies.

Given a ``sopel_modules.plugin`` plugin, Sopel will load everything that is
available from the ``sopel_modules/plugin/__init__.py`` file.

It is the initial version of Sopel's packaged plugins: it can be packaged and
uploaded to `PyPI`_ then installed using ``pip install``.

When a plugin author wants to distribute a Sopel plugin, the best option is to
use an :ref:`Entry point` plugin instead.

Entry point
-----------

.. versionadded:: 7.0

An **Entry point** plugin is a Python module or package distributed via a
``setup.py`` script, and it is available to Sopel via Sopel's ``sopel.plugins``
`setup entry point`__.

Given this definition of an entry point from a ``setup.cfg`` file::

   [options.entry_points]
   sopel.plugins =
       my_plugin = package_name.my_plugin_file

Sopel will load everything available from the ``package_name.my_plugin_file``
Python module under the plugin name ``my_plugin``. It means that you can have
any package name and any module name as long as it is a valid Python module
and as long as you properly define the entry point.

You should write an entry point plugin when:

* you want to distribute your plugin on `PyPI`_
* you want to split the code in multiple files
* you have dependencies beyond Sopel and Python's standard library
* you want a modern and reliable way to package your Sopel plugin
* you want to distribute more than one Sopel plugin per distributed package

An entry point plugin is the best, most flexible way to package and distribute
a Sopel plugin (or collection of plugins) in a clean, easy-to-update manner.

Note that a single Python distributed package can expose more than one Sopel
entry point plugin, which is great to bundle multiple plugins at once.

.. seealso::

   The Python Packaging Authority explains how entry points work and how to
   use them in its `Entry points specification`_.

Naming plugins
==============

Sopel plugins conventionally have all-lowercase names, usually one word.
However, sometimes multiple words are needed for clarity or disambiguation;
``snake_case`` is normally used for these.

How Sopel determines a plugin's name depends on what kind of plugin it is:

Single file
   The file's basename (e.g. ``plugin`` in ``plugin.py``)

Folder
   The folder name (e.g. ``plugin`` in ``~/.sopel/plugins/plugin/__init__.py``)

Namespace package
   The submodule name (e.g. ``plugin`` in ``sopel_modules.plugin``)

Entry point
   The entry point name (e.g. ``plugin`` in ``plugin = my_plugin.module.path``)
