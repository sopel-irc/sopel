This file is dedicated to the people who want to list their names (or handles)
for their contribution to this work. "Sopel" is a fork of "phenny" from
http://inamidst.com/phenny/

The original creator: Sean B. Palmer (sbp) deserves the most credit for
originally creating phenny. He has done an extraordinary job at producing this
project; without him this fork would not exist.

The Jenni years: yano carried the torch onward, making tons of improvements
and shaping what would become Sopel several years later. There must exist an
alternate timeline wherein Jenni (and thus Sopel) never happened.

The Willie-Sopel years: Elsie Powell, with Elad Alfassa and Dimitri Molenaars,
pressed on through two project renames to build what became Sopel 6.x. Thanks
to the foundation they provided, we have had the privilege to take Sopel ever
forward, into its 7.x release (and soon, beyond).

The Sopel years: Many thanks are due again to Elsie Powell for passing Sopel's
reins on to the current generation of user-developers instead of letting the
project die or forcing another fork. We have all benefited from participation
in this project at LEAST as much as our contributions have improved the
software for everyone's use.


Please feel free to add your name if you have added to this project in any way.
