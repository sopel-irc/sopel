"""Management of IRC capability negotiation.

.. versionadded:: 8.0

This module contains the :class:`Capabilities` class which tracks the state of
the capability negotiation with the IRC server: it can store and update the
state of available and enabled capabilities.

.. important::

    Plugin authors should not instantiate this class directly, as the bot
    exposes an instance through its :attr:`~sopel.irc.AbstractBot.capabilities`
    attribute.

    All state handling methods (such as :meth:`Capabilities.handle_ls`) are
    used by the ``coretasks`` plugin, and should not be used outside.
