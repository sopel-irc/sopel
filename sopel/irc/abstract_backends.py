            including the trailing CR-LF. Thus, there are 510 characters
            maximum allowed for the command and its parameters. There is no
            provision for continuation of message lines.

        The length in the RFC refers to the length in *bytes*, which can be
        bigger than the length of the Unicode string. This method cuts the
        message until its length fits within this limit of 510 bytes.

        The returned message contains the CR-LF pair required at the end,
        and can be sent as-is.
