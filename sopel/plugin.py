def capability(

    :param name: name of the capability to negotiate with the server; this
                 positional argument can be used multiple times to form a
                 single ``CAP REQ``
    :param handler: optional keyword argument, acknowledgement handler

    The Client Capability Negotiation is a feature of IRCv3 that exposes a
    mechanism for a server to advertise a list of features and for clients to
    request them when they are available.

    This decorator will register a capability request, allowing the bot to
    request capabilities if they are available. You can request more than one
    at a time, which will make for one single request.

    The handler must follow the
    :class:`sopel.plugins.callables.CapabilityHandler` protocol.

    .. note::

        Due to how Capability Negotiation works, a request will be acknowledged
        or denied all at once. This means that this may succeed::

            @plugin.capability('away-notify')

        But this may not::

            @plugin.capability('away-notify', 'example/incompatible-cap')

        Even though the ``away-notify`` capability is available and can be
        enabled, the second ``CAP REQ`` will be denied because the server won't
        acknowledge a request that contains an incompatible capability.

        In that case, if you don't need both at the same time, you should use
        two different handlers::

            @plugin.capability('away-notify')
            def cap_away_notify(cap_req, bot, ack):
                # handle away-notify acknowledgement

            @plugin.capability('example/incompatible-cap')
            def cap_example_incompatible_cap(cap_req, bot, ack):
                # handle example/incompatible-cap acknowledgement
                # or, most probably, lack thereof

        This will allow the server to acknowledge or deny each capability
        independently.

    .. warning::

        A function cannot be decorated more than once by this decorator, as
        the result is an instance of
        :class:`sopel.plugins.callables.Capability`.

        If you want to handle a ``CAP`` message without requesting the
        capability, you should use the :func:`event` decorator instead.

    .. warning::

        The list of ``name``s is limited in size to prevent the bot from
        separating the ``CAP REQ`` in multiple lines as the bot does not know
        how to call back the capability handler upon receiving the multi-line
        ``ACK * REQ``.

    Plugin functions decorated by ``interval`` must only take

    like ``bot.say()`` will not have a default destination.

    This decorator can be used to add multiple commands to one callable in a
    single line. The resulting match object will have the command as the first
    group; the rest of the line, excluding leading whitespace, as the second
    group; and parameters 1 through 4, separated by whitespace, as groups 3-6.

    Example::

        @command("hello")
            # If the command prefix is "\\.", this would trigger on lines
            # starting with ".hello".

        @command('j', 'join')
            # If the command prefix is "\\.", this would trigger on lines
            # starting with either ".j" or ".join".

    You can use a space in the command name to implement subcommands::

        @command('main sub1', 'main sub2')
            # For ".main sub1", trigger.group(1) will return "main sub1"
            # For ".main sub2", trigger.group(1) will return "main sub2"

    But in that case, be careful with the order of the names: if a more generic
    pattern is defined first, it will have priority over less generic patterns.
    So for instance, to have ``.main`` and ``.main sub`` working properly, you
    need to declare them like this::

        @command('main sub', 'main')
            # This command will react properly to ".main sub" and ".main"

    Then, you can check ``trigger.group(1)`` to know if it was used as
    ``main sub`` or just ``main`` in your callable. If you declare them in the
    wrong order, ``.main`` will have priority and you won't be able to take
    advantage of that.

    Another option is to declare command with subcommands only, like this::

        @command('main sub1')
            # this command will be triggered on .main sub1

        @command('main sub2')

    In that case, ``.main`` won't trigger anything, and you won't have to
    inspect the trigger's groups to know which subcommand is triggered.

    .. note::

        If you use this decorator multiple times, remember that the decorators
        are invoked in the reverse order of appearance::

            # These two decorators...
            @command('hi')
            @command('hello')

            # ...are equivalent to this single decorator

    For compatibility with the built-in help plugin, ``msg`` must use the
    default :attr:`~sopel.config.core_section.CoreSection.help_prefix` if it
    is a prefixed command. Other command types should give example invocations
    that work with Sopel's default settings, especially if using the "example
    test" functionality to automatically generate a test(s) for the function.

    The presence of a ``result`` will generate tests automatically when Sopel's
    test suite is run, using ``msg`` as input. The exact behavior of the tests
    depends on the remaining optional ``example`` arguments.

    Passing ``re=True``, in particular, is useful for matching ``result``\\s
    that are random and/or dependent on an external API. This way, an example
    test can check the format of the result without caring about the exact data.

    Giving a list of ``ignore``d patterns is helpful for commands that may
    return intermittent errors (mostly calls to an external API that isn't
    necessarily stable), especially when coupled with the ``repeat`` parameter.

    By default, Sopel's help plugin will display only one example (the one
    closest to the function's `def` statement, due to how decorators work). You
    can override this choice or include multiple examples by passing
    ``user_help=True`` to one or more ``example`` decorator(s).

    Passing ``online=True`` makes that particular example skippable if Sopel's
    test suite is run in offline mode, which is mostly useful to make life
    easier for other developers working on Sopel without Internet access.

    Finally, ``vcr=True`` records the example's HTTP requests and responses for
    replaying during later test runs. It can be an alternative (or complement)
    to ``online``, and is especially useful for testing plugin code that calls
    on inconsistent or flaky remote APIs. The recorded "cassettes" of responses
    can be committed alongside the code for use by CI services, etc. (See
    `VCR.py <https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy>`_ & `pytest-vcr
