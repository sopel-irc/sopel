    """Generic Job Scheduler.

    :param object manager: manager passed to jobs as argument

    Scheduler is a :class:`thread <threading.Thread>` that keeps track of
    :class:`Jobs <Job>` and periodically checks which ones are ready to
    execute. When ready, their :meth:`~Job.execute` method is called, either
    in a separate thread or in the scheduler's thread (it depends on the
    job's :meth:`~Job.is_threaded` method).

    It can be started as any other thread::

        # on bot's startup
        scheduler = jobs.Scheduler(bot)
        scheduler.start()  # run the thread forever

    Then it runs forever until the :meth:`stop` method is called, usually when
    the bot shuts down.

    .. note::

        Thread safety is ensured with threading's :class:`~threading.Lock`
        and :class:`~threading.Event` when:

        * a job is :meth:`registered <register>` or
          :meth:`removed <remove_callable_job>`
        * the scheduler is :meth:`cleared <clear_jobs>` or
          :meth:`stopped <stop>`
        * the scheduler gets jobs that are ready for execution

        These actions can be performed while the scheduler is running.

    :param handler: function to be called when the job is ready to execute
    :type handler: :term:`function`
    :param str doc: optional documentation for the job

    Job is a simple structure that holds information about when a function
    should be called next. They are best used with a :class:`Scheduler`
    that will manage job execution when they are ready.

    The :term:`function` to execute is the ``handler``, which must be a
    callable with this signature::

        def handler(manager):
            # perform action periodically
            # return is optional

    The ``manager`` parameter can be any kind of object; usually it's an
    instance of :class:`sopel.bot.Sopel`.

    When a job is ready, you can execute it by calling its :meth:`execute`
    method (providing the appropriate ``manager`` argument)::

        if job.is_ready_to_run(time.time()):
            job.execute(manager)  # marked as running
            # "next times" have been updated; the job is not running

    In that case, ``execute`` takes care of the running state of the job.

    Alternatively, you can use a ``with`` statement to perform action before
    and/or after executing the job; in that case, the ``with`` statement takes
    precedence, and the :meth:`execute` method won't interfere::

        with job:
            # the job is now running, you can perform pre-execute action
            job.execute()  # execute the job's action, no state modification
            # the job is still marked as "running"
            # you can perform post-execute action

        # outside of the with statement, the job is not running anymore

    .. seealso::

        The :class:`sopel.plugins.jobs.Scheduler` class is specifically
        designed for plugins' jobs, expecting an instance of
        :class:`sopel.bot.Sopel` as a manager, and should be used to manipulate
        plugin jobs.

        In all other case, the :class:`sopel.tools.jobs.Scheduler` class is a
        generic job scheduler.
