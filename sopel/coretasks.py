"""Core Sopel plugin that handles IRC protocol functions.

This plugin allows the bot to run without user-facing functionality:

* it handles client capability negotiation
* it handles client auth (both nick auth and server auth)
* it handles connection registration (RPL_WELCOME, RPL_LUSERCLIENT), dealing
  with error cases such as nick already in use
* it tracks known channels & users (join, quit, nick change and other events)
* it manages blocked (ignored) users

This is written as a plugin to make it easier to extend to support more
responses to standard IRC codes without having to shove them all into the
dispatch function in :class:`sopel.bot.Sopel` and making it easier to maintain.
