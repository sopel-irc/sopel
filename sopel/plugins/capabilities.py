    Whenever a plugin declares a capability request (through

    this manager.

    The bot is responsible to call the manager at the appropriate time, and the
    manager will store requests' state and handle acknowledgement, by following
    this workflow:

    1. the bot will register plugins' requests with the :meth:`register` method
    2. the bot will request the list of available capabilities with the
       ``CAP LS`` subcommand
    3. upon receiving the list, it'll use the :meth:`request_available` method
       to let the manager send the required ``CAP REQ`` messages.
    4. when the server ``ACK`` a request, the bot will call the
       :meth:`acknowledge` method; when the server ``NAK`` a request, the bot
       will call the :meth:`deny` method
    5. once all requests are handled (either directly or after calling the
       :meth:`resume` method), the bot will send the ``CAP END`` message to end
