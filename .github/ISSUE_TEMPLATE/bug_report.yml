        ### Thanks for helping us improve Sopel!

        Please be sure to check the [discussions](../discussions) and search both open *and closed* [issues](../issues) to see if we're already working on this problem.

        If you can, please try to reproduce the problem on an unmodified copy of the `master` branch first, as sometimes bugs are found and fixed without opening an issue or discussion.

        If the problem hasn't been reported and persists in `master`, you can help us fix it quickly by filling out as much of this information as you can. Thanks!
